Slowly learning data analysis libraries in Python to prepare myself for internships and future opportunities.
I'm using FastF1 because it is a topic I am very passionate about, and it has all sorts of data for me to analyse.
The end goal is to be able to prepare the software for the 2026 season to help predict possible race strategies and car performances to 
better understand the regulation changes.
Using the predicted strategies and car performances in concert with previous race performances to predict race outcomes.
